Wakeup-Lamp
===========

h2. **WARNING:** This project users mains voltage and misuse or lack of knowledge could result in severe injury or even death.
If you don't know what you are doing or are unsure of what you are doing don't attempt this project.

The software required to make a wakeup lamp using a Raspberry Pi, Velleman K8064 DC Controlled Dimmer and a beside lamp.

The code is written in python and users a couple of interesting techniques such as
* A finite state machine
* A PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
In the future I hope to implement a software implemented capacitance touch switch

If I ever get around to it I will post full instructions on [my blog](http://www.my-side-projects.blogspot.co.uk)

**Parts List**
* A Velleman K8064 DC Controlled Dimmer
* Raspberry Pi - www.raspberrypi.org
* SD Card for the Raspberry Pi
* Micro USB Power supply for the Raspberry Pi
* A Wi-Fi dongle for the Raspberry Pi
* Female GPIO wires to connect the Raspberry Pi to the Velleman K8064 Dimmer
* A bedside lamp with enough room to house all the components, I used the SÃ¥ngen lamp from Ikea - http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/50206225
* Perspex to insulate the inside of the lamp from the electronic components
